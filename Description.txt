DESCRIPTION :

Limited_Predict.py: 
In this file we have predicted the price of house using 4 features variable(selected after study from correlation matrix shown), and by fitting  linear regression line using "PREDICT" method of Linearregression class.

All_Predict.py: 
In this file we have predicted the price of house using all feature variables, and by fitting linear regression line using "PREDICT"  method of LinearRegression class.

Limited_Gradient.py: 
In this file we have predicted price of house using 4 feature variable, and fitting linear regression line using theoritical concept(Gradient Descent Algorithm).

All_Gradient.py:
In this file we have predicted price of house using all feature variables , and fitting linear regression line  using theoritical concept(Gradient Descent Algorithm).

At the end of all file we have shown 'Average percentage error in predicted price as compared to original price ;for train and test set'
and 'R2 value and Rootmeansquare error for train and test set'.

From the observations of percentage error , it will be clear that difference between -percentage error using all features and 4 features is
very less, from which we can conclude that selected 4 feature variable predicts the price very well(which is mostly close to price predicted by using all feature variables).

Also R2 value(in all files) is approx 0.7 , which concludes good performance of created model.

Also ,we have tried to decrease average percentage error in predicted price(By using Gradient Descent algorithm), as compared to average percentage error using "PREDICT" method of python inbuilt module.
